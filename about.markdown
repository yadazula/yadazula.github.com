## The Author

Welcome, my name is Gokhan Demir a software developer from Istanbul, Turkey. I have a big passion for software development. 
I try to write code for other developers, [not the computers.][Code_Write_Link] 
I like to simply complicated problems and try to follow [KISS][KISS_Link], [DRY][DRY_Link], [YAGNI][YAGNI_Link] and [SOLID][SOLID_Link] principles. 

## What does yadazula means ?

Unfortunately I have very common name. There are lots of people have the same name [as me.][Linkedin_Gokhan] 
So I need to choose another nick. When in high school summer camp, we participated a soccer tournament and 
the name of our team was yadazula which in fact a made-up word. That's story of this strange word. (btw, yes we won the cup !)
